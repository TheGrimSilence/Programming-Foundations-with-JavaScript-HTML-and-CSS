# Welcome to my Duke CS learnings from Coursera!

This repository covers content from [Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML and CSS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/duke-programming-web) which is part of the [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming) which I guess isn't *technically* **Computer Science** but I make do with what I can. 

If you're interested in what I actually took all at once,

- [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)
- [Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-programming-java)
- [Computer Science: Algorithms, Theory, and Machines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-algorithms-theory-machines)
- [Introduction to Mathematical Thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking)

I chose these for my own learning and somewhat to refresh myself on some basics I haven't used in years. I highly recommend you learn things your way.
